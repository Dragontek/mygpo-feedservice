~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mygpo-feedservice is a webservice that parses podcast feeds and returns
simplified contents as JSON. It is intended to run within a Google AppEngine.

To run it locally for testing and development, either point the APPENGINE_SDK
variable in makefile to an unpacked Google App Engine SDK for Python, which can
be downloaded from

 http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/google_appengine_1.4.0.zip

Afterwards `make runserver` should start the development server.


An instance of mygpo-feedservice should be running at
